[["index.html", "Data Analysis for Clinical Researchers Preface", " Data Analysis for Clinical Researchers Albert Cobos Preface This is an introductory book on data analysis for clinical researchers. Data analysis methods are presented through real data examples relevant to clinical research. We focus on concepts, interpretation, and statistical thinking, avoiding or minimizing the mathematical basis of statistical methods, in line with the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE), and with modern data science. Data analysis requires the use of some software to read and analyze data, and to produce some outputs. There are lots of software tools one may use for this purpose, such as SAS, SPSS, Stata, and many other. This book is based on the R language (R, for short), a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. These are the main reasons to choose R: It is a free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License. May be used with the three major platforms: Windows, Linux and Mac. Has very good graphic capabilities. Is well documented, including an easily accessible help system. It is extensible, and has a growing and very active user community.

Chapter 2 is an introduction to data structures frequently used in R to store data. This is a wearisome subject, but it is important to become familiar with R. The remaining chapters follow the chronological order of tasks to be carried out in any real case of data analysis: acquire the data (chapter 3), prepare the data for analysis (chapter 4), explore the data (chapter 5), conduct inferential analyses (chapters 6-9), and report the results (chapter 10). In this book you will find R tutorials in gray areas containig R code, just like this one: # This will print the date of your system in the console Sys.Date() By hovering the cursor over the top-right corner of gray area, you will be able to copy the whole of its contents, and paste it in the RStudio editor. It is extremely important that you run the R code shown in tutorials (in the first tutorial we provide detailed instructions on how to do this). R programming is a skill, and you wonâ€™t develop skills by just reading how to do something. Rather, you need to get your hands dirty by doing. In this case, this means to write R code or, at least copying it and running it to see what happens.
